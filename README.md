# Compiler-Design-Tool-project

A web-based tool for visualizing and processing grammars and expressions, featuring left factoring and recursion elimination, math expression trees, and English grammar trees.

## Features

- **Left Factoring and Left Recursion Eliminator**: Removes left recursion and left factoring from a given grammar, making it suitable for top-down parsing.
- **Math Expression Trees**: Generates syntax and parse trees for mathematical expressions, visualizing operator precedence and structure.
- **English Grammar Trees**: Creates syntax and parse trees for English sentences based on a context-free grammar, with distinct levels of detail.
- **Tabbed Interface**: Navigate between features without page reloads using a responsive navbar.
- **Modern Design**: Clean, responsive UI with a gradient theme, built with CSS.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Uses D3.js to render tree structures dynamically.
